---

## 🛠️ Customization

* Update **scene content** inside `AnimatedFeatures.jsx`
* Add icons, images, or tab groups in each scene
* Adjust **GSAP timeline** for more complex animations
* Change **gradient backgrounds** in `animated.scss`

---

## 🎨 Animation Details

* **Scene 1:** Fade in headline “Customize Chrome your way”
* **Scene 2:** Fade in headline “Add powerful extensions”
* **Scene 3:** Fade in headline “Take control of your tabs”
* **Scene 4:** Fade in headline “Helpful features built-in”

All scenes use `ScrollTrigger` to **animate only when in viewport**. The container is pinned with `position: sticky` to give a smooth scrolling effect.

---

## 📌 Notes

* This is **not a full Chrome clone**, only a scroll-driven interactive showcase.
* All animations are handled by **GSAP** for precise timing and smooth transitions.
* Fully responsive and optimized for modern browsers.

Do you want me to also **add a live demo link and GIF preview section** in the README so it’s more attractive for GitHub?
